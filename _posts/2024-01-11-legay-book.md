We are happy to announce the publication of **Richard Legays** PhD,**The Cultural Histories of Radio Luxembourg and Europe n°1. Broadcasting Across Europe**, Palgrave macmillan, 2024.

<!-- more -->

This book focuses on two commercial radio stations, Radio Luxembourg and Europe n°1, which were popular institutions in Western Europe throughout the Long Sixties, working across media and broadcasting transnationally. It argues that the existence of an overarching ‘dispositif ’ of commercial radio stations enabled them to operate on various dimensions and differentiated them from other broadcasters. The book therefore answers current calls in media history to look beyond national and single-medium borders and contributes to the cultural and media history of Western Europe.
