Popkult60: A closer look at popular culture in Europe over the long decade of the 1960s

<!-- more -->

We are an interdisciplinary research group focusing on the transnational history of popular culture in the 60s, composed of members from the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C²DH), the Institute for History at the University of Luxembourg and the University of Saarland.

This is a three-year project between Germany and Luxembourg, which has received €2 million in funding from the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR) and the German Research Foundation (DFG). The research team is composed of three professors from Saarland University (Prof. Dietmar Hüser, spokesman for the research unit, Prof. Clemens Zimmerman and Prof. Christoph Vatter) and three professors from the University of Luxembourg (Prof. Andreas Fickers, Prof. Sonja Kmec and Prof. Benoît Majerus). The grant will provide funding for seven PhD students, four at Saarland University and three at the University of Luxembourg.
