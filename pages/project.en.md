Compared to the United States or to Britain, the history of popular culture has long had a difficult academic record in many continental European countries. Although this has changed there in the last two decades as well: popular cultural products, phenomena and practices have now entered the history of contemporary research and in recent manuals on the history of the twentieth century, they are partly marginal, partly extensive.

Nevertheless, the potential for recognition of popular culture for the change in social and political conditions is still underestimated, and many relevant topics are still scientifically fallow. This is even more true from a transnational point of view and for European dimensioned examinations. Even if lot about methods and concepts of transnational history have been written, clearly delineated, source-based studies that focus on aspects of popular culture in two or more societies in terms of comparative, transfer, and interlinking history are still the exception rather than the rule.

The project "Popular Culture Transnational - Europe in the Long 1960s" aims to fill obvious contemporary historical desiderata in the field of transnational popular culture, to underpin theoretical debates with empirical case studies and to demonstrate the added value of transnational access to single country analyses. This is to be done through seven popular culture studies, all of which look beyond national borders and consider several countries, cultures and societies.

Particularly far-reaching insights is making possible through the common spatial - Western European - and temporal - the long 1960s - framing as well as the fundamentally interwoven research designs, that avoid the potential "ivory tower" risks by joining projects, and give the possibility of a highly-functional approach and almost inevitable synergies between the projects. Therefore, all planned examinations in the core are deliberately mutually interdependent, operate consistently with the same, at least with similar key questions and locate themselves in several research-relevant and eponymous fields of tension of "popular culture transnational".
