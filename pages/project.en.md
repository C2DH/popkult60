## "Transnational popular culture – Europe in the long 1960s"
<!-- more -->

Compared to the United States or to Britain, the history of popular culture has long had a difficult academic record in many continental European countries. Although this has also changed in the last two decades: popular cultural products, phenomena and practices have now entered the history of contemporary research and in recent writings on the history of the twentieth century, some are marginal, while some are extensive.

Nevertheless, the potential for recognition of popular culture as a tool for change in social and political conditions is still underestimated, and many relevant topics are still scientifically uncultivated. This is even more true from a transnational point of view and for European-focused examinations. Even if much has been written about methods and concepts of transnational history, clearly delineated, source-based studies that focus on aspects of popular culture in two or more societies in terms of comparison, transfer, and interlinking histories are still the exception rather than the rule.

The project "Popular Culture Transnational - Europe in the Long 1960s" aims to fill obvious contemporary historical desiderata in the field of transnational popular culture, to underpin theoretical debates with empirical case studies and to demonstrate the added value of transnational access to single country analyses. This is to be done through seven popular culture studies, all of which look beyond national borders and consider several countries, cultures and societies.

Particularly far-reaching insights are made possible through the common spatial - Western European - and temporal - the long 1960s - framing as well as the fundamentally interwoven research designs, that avoid the potential "ivory tower" risks by joining projects, and give the possibility of a highly-functional approach and almost inevitable synergies between the projects. Therefore, all planned examinations at their core are deliberately mutually interdependent, operate consistently with the same, at least with similar key questions and locate themselves in several research-relevant and eponymous fields of tension of "transnational popular culture"

The various projects are supervised by professors from the university of Saarland and the university of Luxembourg.

The project is led by Professor [Dietmar Hüser](https://popkult60.eu/people/), who is the spokesperson of the project, and the coordination is led by [Maude Williams](https://popkult60.eu/ people/); both working at the University of Saarland.
