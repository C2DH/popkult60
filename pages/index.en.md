Welcome to the website of the research project **"Transnational popular culture – Europe in the long 1960s"** supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) in Germany and the National Research Fund (FNR) in Luxembourg. This website serves as a deeper insight into “Popkult60: A closer look at popular culture in Europe over the long decade of the 1960s". Our interdisciplinary team is composed of researchers from the [Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C²DH)](https://c2dh.uni.lu) and the [Institute for History (IHIST)](https://history.uni.lu/) at the [Université du Luxembourg](https://wwwen.uni.lu/), and the Historisches Institut ([Lehrstuhl für europäische Zeitgeschichte](https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/zeitgeschichte/hueser.html) and [Lehrstuhls für Kultur- und Mediengeschichte](http://www.kmg.uni-saarland.de)) and the Romanistik ([Interkulturelle Kommunikation](https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/vatter/start.html)) of the [Universität des Saarlandes](https://www.uni-saarland.de/nc/startseite.html).

Our objective is to analyze European cultural transfers in a transnational perspective in the "long" 1960s. On this website you will find information on the fields of tension that are at the heart of the [project](https://c2dh.github.io/popkult60/about/) as well as the descriptions of the different [research fields](https://c2dh.github.io/popkult60/fields/) covered by our [researchers](https://c2dh.github.io/popkult60/researchers/). You can also follow the progress of our research by consulting our [blog](https://c2dh.github.io/popkult60/blog/) or by contacting us directly.
