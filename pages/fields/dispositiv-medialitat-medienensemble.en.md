-	Systematic analysis and reflection on intermedia references in mass media ensembles: for each theme a particular attention to individual media is paid (radio, TV, comics, movies, etc.)
-	Role of media in the construction of popular cultural identities, e.g. the mediality of the long 1960s as a central theme of sub-projects
-	Relevance of the concept of package/”dispositif” as analytical category to sharpen the sense of technical & material dimensions, content & aesthetics, and perception, strongly linked to media
-	Semio-pragmatical use of package/”dispositif” to support the constituent meaning of “spaces” in media uses and to historically capture processes of localisation
