- Locations, spaces and places as central categories of cultural and media analysis: challenge all the limitations of communication at the age of transnational media flows
- Great relevance of flows and transfers of media products and concrete social spaces where they are appropriated (youth clubs, family living rooms, etc.)
- Significance of local references and local imaginations that are often part of popular media products
-	Interaction between media professionals (such as movies enthusiasts) and avant-garde artists in social spaces outside of their field.
-	Necessity to adapt media products to national, regional and local cultures and languages, that are rarely similar on a global scale
